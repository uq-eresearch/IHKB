    <blockquote class="feature-quote"><strong>The aim of this research project is to understand how region-specific cultural practices combined with other regional and contextual factors, impact on the needs analysis of Aboriginal housing.</strong></blockquote>

    <p>Factors that will be considered include cultural practices, climate/weather, economics, community issues, access to services and facilities, socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the neighborhood, circular mobility and mining. Our aim is to understand how these factors impact on housing needs analysis (in the short term) and on the health and well-being of Indigenous communities and the prevalence of homelessness and overcrowding (in the longer term) – across regions. By improving our understanding of regional factors, we will develop regional needs analysis models that can inform and tailor Indigenous housing policies (and associated housing programs) in response to local contexts.</p>

    <p>To address Indigenous housing needs at present, researchers have to manually trawl through large volumes of heterogeneous distributed information (in the form of quantitative data, qualitative data and textual publications) scattered across numerous organizations and databases around Australia. There is no single point of access to an integrated system that enables analysis and synthesis of qualitative, quantitative and textual information via an interactive mapping interface. Moreover, single sources of data on Indigenous Housing are often inaccurate and provide an incomplete picture of the true extent of overcrowding, tenant demand and adequacy of housing stock. Hence, a key goal of this project is to provide researchers (and in the longer term policy makers) with a Web Portal to a more comprehensive integrated knowledge-base that aggregates data from multiple organizations into a single data model (or ontology) and online searchable repository. A second goal is to enable the data to be queried, aggregated, analysed and visualized spatially via an interface that enables layering of regional, cultural and political boundaries and information and drilling down into the data at finer spatio-temporal scales.</p>

    <p>Given this integrated knowledge-base, the project will develop innovative search, retrieval, visualization and analysis services to enable the CIs to identify the factors that cause: difficulties accessing and sustaining tenancies, housing shortages, high levels of evictions, frequent moves, property damage, overcrowding, homelessness and poor quality of life (QoL) in many Indigenous housing settlements. More specifically, online mapping interfaces and analysis services will be developed that enable domain experts to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Overlay different datasets spatially to develop hypotheses regarding relationships between regional factors and QoL/socio-economic indicators;</li>
      <li>Apply R statistical analysis tools to the data to identify negative and positive correlations between housing attributes and QoL/socio-economic indicators and to identify the factors that had the most impact on an Indigenous Housing program’s ability to satisfy the housing needs in a given region;</li>
      <li>Identify links between Indigenous Housing Programs and Housing Management Practices and Indigenous Housing Policies (at the State and Commonwealth level).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These innovative e-Research tools will enable the domain experts to identify and quantify variations in patterns across regions. They will enable the researchers to more quickly develop and test hypotheses about the impact of different regional factors and to develop models that can be used to inform Indigenous housing policy-makers and resource managers across Australia.</p>
    <p>Midja is a Dyirrbal word meaning shelter or house.</p>
